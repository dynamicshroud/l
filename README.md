# l
l is an ls alternative made because i think that ls is too long to type in the terminal

seriously, this is a joke program and if anything if you want a nicer interface, use ls.

but if you want better performance and smaller code use l. because not using l is a massive L.

Usage: `l <directory>`

you dont have to use an argument but its nice to anyways
